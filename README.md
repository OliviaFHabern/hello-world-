Hi there, my name is Olivia and I'm a rising Junior at the University of California Berkeley. I've never used Git Hub before, so this is pretty exciting. 

1 Thessalonians 4:17
"...and so we will always be with the Lord."

Ezekiel 36:26 
"And I will give you a new heart, and a new spirit I will put within you. And I will remove the heart of stone from your flesh and give you a heart of flesh."
